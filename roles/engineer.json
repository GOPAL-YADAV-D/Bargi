    "Can you explain the difference between a process and a thread?",
    "How do you handle error handling in your code?",
    "Describe a challenging bug you fixed recently.",
    "What is your experience with CI/CD pipelines?",
    "Explain the concept of RESTful APIs and their advantages.",
    "How would you optimize a slow database query?",
    "What are the SOLID principles and why are they important?",
    "Describe a time you had a disagreement with a team member about a technical decision.",
    "How do you stay updated with new technologies and industry trends?",
    "Explain the CAP theorem and provide a real-world example."

    "System Design",
    "Data Structures & Algorithms",
    "Debugging & Problem Solving",
    "Code Quality & Best Practices",

    "Testing & Quality Assurance",
    "Performance Optimization",
    "Version Control & DevOps"
  ],
  "sample_good_answers": [
    "I use a try-catch block for expected errors and ensure I log the stack trace for debugging. For critical failures, I implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff. I also use custom exception types to make error handling more semantic and easier to debug.",
    "I identified a memory leak in our production service by profiling the heap usage over time. I traced it to an unclosed database connection in a loop. I fixed it by using a context manager and implementing proper connection pooling.",
    "I prefer to write unit tests before implementing features (TDD) to ensure requirements are met and prevent regressions. I aim for at least 80% code coverage and use integration tests for critical paths."
  ],
  "sample_bad_answers": [
    "I just check if it works on my machine and ship it.",
    "I don't really like writing tests, they take too much time and slow down development.",
    "If the server gets slow, I usually just restart it and that fixes the problem."
